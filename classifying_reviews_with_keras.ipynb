    "# Classifying Movie Reviews from IMDb\n",
    "\n",
    "The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is an online database consisting of movie, TV, and video game information.  Our goal is to analyze a dataset of movie reviews from IMDb and use the Python neural network library [Keras](https://keras.io/) to predict the sentiment of a movie review.  The dataset consists of 25,000 movie reviews from IMDb, labeled by sentiment (positive review or negative review). Reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a sequence of word indices (integers).  Words are indexed by overall frequency in the dataset, so for example the integer 1 corresponds to the most frequent word in the dataset, 2 corresponds to the 2nd most frequent word, etc.  Therefore, a sentence is represented by a sequence of integers, and each movie review can be encoded as an integer vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For humans, it is easy to predict the sentiment of a review.  This is something we want to train the model to do."

LSTM is an abbreviation for Long Short-Term Memory Unit, and these were originally proposed as a solution to the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem).  In a nutshell, the vanishing gradient problem is a problem when training neural networks with gradient descent methods and back-propagation.  When a neural network is trained, it tries to minimize a cost function by back-propagating the error through the network and repeatedly computing the gradients of composite functions through the layers.  Eventually, the gradients become so small that it's very hard to continue updating the weights to train the network.  LSTMs help preserve the error that is back-propagated through the network. "
