# IMDb Movie Review Classifier

This project is my first attempt at using Keras to implement a neural network model.  It requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/) with [TensorFlow backend](https://keras.io/backend/)

The report for the project is written in a Jupyter Notebook and is available [here](https://github.com/marty-vanhoof/IMdb_Movie_Review_Classifier/blob/master/classifying_reviews_with_keras.ipynb).  The Python script for training and getting the model results is [here](https://github.com/marty-vanhoof/IMdb_Movie_Review_Classifier/blob/master/imdb_models.py).  I don't recommend running neural network models in the Jupyter Notebook, as it tends to be very slow and sometimes crashes.
